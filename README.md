# AccurateLocation
This Repo reproduces the results that can achieve sub-pixel accuracy for estimating the location of edges on two papers:
1. Lantao Yu and Michael T. Orchard, "Accurate Edge Location Identification Based on Location-directed Image Modeling", Proc. ICIP, 2019.
2. Lantao Yu, "Determining accurate locations of edges in natural images: A phase-based, nonparametric framework", Master Thesis, Rice University, 2016.


To run the code, simply run main.m in Matlab.
